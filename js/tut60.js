// Object Destructuring:-
// The object destructuring is a useful feature of javascript to extract properties from objects and bind them to variables. An object destructuring is also capable of extracting multiple properties in one statement and can access properties from nested objects. It sets a default value if the property does not exist. Let us take a look at what problem JavaScript destructuring solves. Sometimes, we need top-level variables like:

const person = {  
first: 'John',  
last: 'Addison', 
country: 'UK',  
twitter: '@john_adison'};
const first = person.first;
const last = person.last;
// We get this repetitive code over and over again, where we need to make a variable from something that is inside of an object or inside of an array. Here instead of creating multiple variables, we destructure them in a single line like:

const { first, last } = person;
// This is the new destructuring syntax. The above code says: give us a variable first and last, and take it from the person object.  

console.log(first); // John
console.log(last); // Addison
// Similarly, if we also wanted the country, we would add the country into our code, like:

const { first, last, country} = person;
// Array Destructuring:-
// In array destructuring, we use an array literal on the left of an assignment expression. Each variable name on the array literal maps to the corresponding item at the same index on the destructured array. Here is a simple example:

var arr = ["Hello", "World"]  
// destructuring assignment  
var [first, second] = arr;  
console.log(first); // Hello  
console.log(second); // World  
Output:-

Hello

World

// In the above example, the left-hand side of the destructuring assignment is for defining what values are required to unpack from sourced variable. By using the rest operator (â€¦) in array destructuring, we can put all the remaining elements of an array in a new array. Here is an example.

var colors = ["Violet", "Indigo", "Blue", "Green"];  
// destructuring assignment  
var [a,b,...c] = colors;  
console.log(a);   
console.log(b);   
console.log(ac);  
Output:-

Violet

Indigo

[ 'Blue', 'Green']

// Summary:-
// The destructuring is a powerful feature that lets us extract properties from an object/array and bind these values to variables. The unique thing about destructuring is its concise syntax and ability to extract multiple variables in one statement.

// Code file tut60.js as described in the video
console.log('This is tutorial 60');
// Destructuring in JavaScript

let a, b;
[a, b] = [34, 564];
// console.log(a, b);

[a, b, c, ...d] = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, 11, 12, 13];
// console.log(a)
// console.log(b)
// console.log(c)
// console.log(d)


// Array Destructuring
({a, b, c, ...d} = {a: 34, b:345, c:67, d:45, e:34})
// console.log(a, b, c, d)

const fruits = ['Apple', 'Bananas', 'Mangoes'];
[a, b, c] = fruits;
// console.log(a, b, c)


// Object Destructuring
const laptop ={
    model: "HP Pavilion",
    age: "23 days",
    gender: "Male",
    net: 1233,
    start: function (){console.log('started');}
    }

const {model, age, gender, net, start} = laptop;
console.log(model, age, gender, net, start);
start()
